Exercise: Tracking Human Growth

Data files, `girl_height.csv` and `boy_height.csv` contain data on the height and weight of both boys and girls as they grow old. The data contains extra text, and an inconsistent access.

Steps:
1. Import data into `pandas` library in python.  
2. Remove extra string characters from data which describe units of values.  
3. Convert columns of data to numeric types.  
4. Transform age data to be consistent. The first 23 points are in months and the remaining describe years.  
5. Expand the time series data point number using interpolation.  
5. Plot the data.
